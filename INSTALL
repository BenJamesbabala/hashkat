##

notes from a fresh install of linux mint (should be the same for debian or ubuntu)

sudo apt-get install g++
OR
sudo apt-get install clang
sudo apt-get install cmake

if you build with clang, do the following

clang seems to have better c++11 support on some distributions, so if you have issues with g++ give clang a try

export CC=clang
export CXX=clang++


### To build #k@ on your machine

./run.sh -O --build

This will build #k@ and optimized version of #k@ (if you omit the -O, it will generate a debug version of the code)

### To install and run

You will need to set the following environment variable

export HASHKAT=/path/to/hashkat

for example

export HASHKAT=~/git/hashkat

(not there is no trailing /)

you should also add the following directories to your PATH

export PATH=$PATH:$HASHKAT/build/src
export PATH=$PATH:$HASHKAT

### These build instructions should go above

To install kOSN, you will need to have the following:

- cmake (probably available through your friendly neighbourhood package manager)

- yaml (try 'pip install pyyaml')

- networkx (for analysis)
- matplotlib (for analysis)

#### OS X

AD -- TODO: Notes about scipy
Both cmake and yaml are available through brew

(sudo)
port install cmake
brew install cmake
pip install pyyaml
pip install networkx
