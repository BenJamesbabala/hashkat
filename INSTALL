##

notes from a fresh install of linux mint (should be the same for debian or ubuntu)

sudo apt-get install g++
OR
sudo apt-get install clang
sudo apt-get install cmake

if you build with clang, do the following

clang seems to have better c++11 support on some distributions, so if you have issues with g++ give clang a try

export CC=clang
export CXX=clang++


### To build #k@ on your machine

./run.sh -O --build

This will build #k@ and optimized version of #k@ (if you omit the -O, it will generate a debug version of the code)

### To install and run

You will need to set the following environment variable

export HASHKAT=/path/to/hashkat

for example

export HASHKAT=~/git/hashkat

(not there is no trailing /)

you should also add the following directories to your PATH

export PATH=$PATH:$HASHKAT/build/src
export PATH=$PATH:$HASHKAT

### These build instructions should go above

To install kOSN, you will need to have the following:

- cmake (probably available through your friendly neighbourhood package manager)

- yaml (try 'pip install pyyaml')

- networkx (for analysis)
- matplotlib (for analysis)

#### OS X

AD -- TODO: Notes about scipy
Both cmake and yaml are available through brew

(sudo)
port install cmake
brew install cmake
pip install pyyaml
pip install networkx




The **#k@** project is compatible with both Mac OS X and Linux.

We will go over the steps to install these programs for each particular operating system below.

# Mac OS X

Here outlines the following steps on how to install **#k@** on Mac OS X:

1. Download the latest build of **#k@** at [hashkat.org](http://hashkat.org).
2. Enter a terminal and go into your *Downloads* directory/folder by typing in the following command and pressing **Enter**:

    `cd Downloads`

3. To see the list of files in your *Downloads* directory, type into the command line:

    `ls`

4. Amongst your various other downloads you should see the following:

    `hashkat.2015.06.24.tar`

    Please note that the date in the file you downloaded may be different from the one above. That's totally fine, it just means that you've downloaded a newer version of **#k@**!

5. To unpack this tar file, type in the command:

    `tar -xf hashkat.2015.06.24.tar`

6. Once this is completed, look into the list of files in this directory and you will see amongst them:

    `hashkat`

7. For ease of access, move this directory into your 'home' directory by typing in the command:

    `mv ~/Downloads/hashkat/ ~/`	

8. Now return to you 'home' directory by typing in the command:

    `cd`

9. Let's now go into the *hashkat* directory by typing in the command:

    `cd hashkat`

10. Once in this directory, you can see the list of all the files and directories that compose the **#k@** project by again typing in the command:

    `ls`

11. You must now do a build of **#k@** on your computer by typing in the command:

    `./build.sh -O --build`

    You may need to install additional tools on to your computer to build **#k@**. If a prompt appears asking you to do so, please do. You may also need to install the 'CMake' package to your computer to build **#k@**. If so, steps 12 and 13 outline how to install this package.

12. You may not be able to build **#k@** on your computer due to the lack of the 'CMake' package. You can install this package to your computer using 'Homebrew'.
To install 'Hmebrew' to your computer, simply type in the command:

    `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

13. With 'Homebrew', you can install 'CMake' into your computer by using the command:

    `brew install cmake`

    With this installed, you should be able to build **#k@** in the manner outlined in step 11. Steps 14-20 outline a manner in which you can run **#k@** from not only this directory, but any directory where *INFILE.yaml* is present. It involves modifying your *.bashrc* and *.profile* files, and is not essential to the running of **#k@** if you do not wish to do so. Proceed to the next step if you wish to make these changes, or skip ahead to step 21 if you do not.

14. In order to run simulations using **#k@** anywhere on your computer, you must first edit the *.bashrc* file. You can enter this file by typing in the command:

    `nano ~/.bashrc`

15. Once inside this file, assuming you have *hashkat* at the top of your 'home' directory, you must type in:

    `export HASHKAT=~/hashkat`

    `export PATH=$PATH:$HASHKAT/build/src`

    `export PATH=$PATH:$HASHKAT`

16. Exit this file by pressing **ctrl-x**. If you are asked whether or not changes should be saved, type in **y** to say 'yes'.

17. You must then enter the *.profile* file by typing in the command:

    `nano ~/.profile`

18. In this file, type in:

    `source ~/.bashrc`

19. Once you have exited this file, reload the *.bashrc* and *.profile* files by typing in the command:
    
    `source ~/.profile`

20. You can now run **#k@** in this *hashkat* directory, as well as any other directory as long as it has *INFILE.yaml* within in it.

21. You can run **#k@** by typing in:

    `./run.sh`

    You can also run it by typing in:

    `run.sh`

    to run it in this directory or any other directory that contains *INFILE.yaml* within it if you completed steps 14 - 20.

22. It is also recommended to download and install ['Gephi'](http://gephi.github.io/) from their website to use for visualizations of collected data.

With **#k@** installed on your computer, please proceed to the following pages in the documentation to learn how to fully utilize this program.

# Linux

Here outlines the following steps on how to install **#k@** on Linux:
