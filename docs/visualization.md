# Visualization

Here we shall outline ways in which you can visualize some of that data you have collected using [Gephi](http://gephi.github.io/). There are many other programs you can use for visualization, and you are encouraged to try them, we're just going to focus using Gephi however in this documentation.

## How to Visualize a Network

You can download Gephi through there [website](http://gephi.github.io/). Once you have finished downloading Gephi, enter the program, and we will go over the steps necessary to visualize the networks you've created.

1. When entering the program, you will see a prompt similar to the one below appear on the screen. 

	![Gephi - Welcome](/img/visualization/gephi_welcome.png "Gephi - Welcome")

    Under 'New Project' click 'Open Graph File...' to access the appropriate output file created from your network simulation to be used on Gephi.

2. The file used to visualize your network and its most popular tweet are the *network.gexf* file and *retweet_viz.gexf* file respectively. These can be found in the output directory after running a simulation. Click on whichever **.gexf** file you perfer and press 'Open'.

3. After opening the graph file you will be visualizing, the following prompt will appear:

    ![Gephi - Import Report](/img/visualization/gephi_import_report.png "Gephi - Import Report")

    There is nothing that you have to change here so you can simply press 'OK'.
