# A Diverse Network of Agents

As you have clearly noticed working through these tutorials, #k@ offers the opportunity for users to create network simulations consisiting of a truly dynamic and varied set of agents. A multilingual, multiregional network consisting of agents of many different ideologies, preferences, personalities, and types is one that truly models the human race and is exactly what we strive to do here with #k@. In this tutorial, we will go over every aspect in which you can individualize agents in your network, to give you the freedom and means to create the most realistic network simulations possible.
