# The Twitter Follow Model

The twitter follow model is a combination of all of the other follow models, with each model respectively weighted. This potentially results in a network where some follows are random, some are based on which agent has the highest number of followers, other are based on what the agents's agent type is, while others are based on the number of followers an agent of a particular agent type has, and others are based on the hashtags present in tweets. Undeniably the most complex of all the follow models, we will create twitter follow model network simulation based on what we've learned in the previous tutorials. The files that we will use in this simulation can be found for reference in the tutorials directory in hashkat, with this one being under the title tutorial08. You can also view the input file we will be creating for this example [here](https://github.com/hashkat/hashkat/blob/master/tutorials/tutorial07/INFILE.yaml). This tutorial should take approximately 15 minutes to complete.

## Next Steps

Wit hthe completion of this tutorial, you have now familiarized yourslef with all of the follow models offered by #k@. You now have the fundamental knowledge necessary to create a variety of different network simulations using this program. Move onwards to the following tutorials, where we shall move on from the basics, and proceed to some of the more advanced aspects of #k@ which are necessary to be implemented into your network simulations to produce the more realistic data possible.
