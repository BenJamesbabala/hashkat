Here contains the write-up, images, and input files used in the #k@ documentation found on http://docs.hashkat.org/en/latest/. Some aspects of the documentation due eventually have to be fixed however. These include:

* Tutorial 13 needs to be fixed (Scenario 1 - tweet and follow rates not working properly; Scenario 2 - needs agent type region weight enhancement); referred to as final tutorial, which may of course change

* Tutorial 10 - not all of the retweeters are showing in visualization 

* Tutorial 9 - following via retweet not working properly, tutorial needs to be redone when working

* Tutorial 5 - plot error

* Output - dd_by_follow_model, tweets_distro, retweets_distro when fixed needs to be replaced

* Tutorial 4 - categories distro output file screenshot may need to be replaced when categories distro is fixed

* No Interactive Mode

* No follow rank plot commands

* Possibly Next Steps in Tutorial 12 should be updated when tutorial 13 is fixed and/or further tutorials are created

* doc search engine shows old pages (Search "config_static")

* No video for tutorials 9, 10, 13, and the output of Tutorial 5 due to errors 

* Tutorial 8 would benefit from having a discussion on its dd_by_follow_model output file when it is fixed

* Update citation page when 'Transcending language barriers in a realistic model of an online social network' paper is submitted

* No mention in the documentation of the network queries from *network.h* that can be inputted to learn certain network information
