# Getting Started

## What is a Social Network?

A social network is an online system of connections made by users to interact
with one another. The purpose of #k@ is to simulate these social networks
through implementation of the Kinetic Monte Carlo Method.

## What is the Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) Method?



##Running a Simple Network

For this first tutorial, we're going to run a simple network using #k@.
If you look into the #k@ directory / folder, you will find several 
different files and directories. For now we are just going to look at
INFILE.yaml, which is the file we use to input how we would like to 
configure our simulated network.

In this file, you will see all the different configurations whih you can
implement into your network. A detailed description of every single one
of these configurations can be found on the 'Input' page. For this tutorial,
it is only necessary to know that we have a constant number of entities 
or users in this network, 10,000, and that the simulation will run for 10,000
simulated minutes and a maximum of 1 minute real time.
