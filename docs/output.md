# Output

This page serves as a reference for users who have run a simulation, and wish to analyze the data this run has outputted. This page goes over every aspect of the files found in the output directory.

`Categories_Distro.dat`

Outlines the number of tweets, follows, and retweets in their respective bin
thresholds. Appears in twitter-preferential modelled simulations.

`connections_vs_nodes.dat`



`cumulative-degree_distribution_month_000.dat`

Outlines all the possible total degrees an entity can have in that particular
month in the simulation, as well as its normalized probability, logarithm, and
normalized probability logarithm in columns in that order.

`dd_by_entity_type.dat`



`dd_by_follow_model.dat`



`entity_followers.dat`



`entity_following.dat`



`entity_populations.dat`



`entity_retweets.dat`



`entity_tweets.dat`



`in-degree_distribution_month_000.dat`

Outlines all the possible in degrees an entity can have in that particular
month in the simulation, as well as its normalized probability, logarithm, and
normalized probability logarithm in columns in that order.

`main_stats.dat`

Outlines the most important network statistics for this simulation.
Under **USERS** we have the total number of entities by the simulation's end,
and the number and percentage of those entities are of each particular entity
type. Under **TWEETS** we have the total number of tweets made
during the simulation, as well as the number and percentage of those that
have a hashtag and the number and percentage of those that were tweeted by
entities of each type. Under **RETWEETS** we have the total number of
retweets that occurred throughout the course of the simulation, and how
many of those were done by entities of each type.
Under **FOLLOWS** we have !!!!!!!!!!!!

`model_match.dat`



`network.dat`

Outlines which entities are following who. In this file there are two columns,
with the entities in the first column (classified by an ID number)
following the entities in the listed in the second column (also classified
by an ID number).

`network.gexf`



`out-degree_distribution_month_000.dat`

Outlines all the possible out degrees an entity can have in that particular
month in the simulation, as well as its normalized probability, logarithm, and
normalized probability logarithm in columns in that order.

`retweets_distro.dat`



`retweet_viz.gexf`



`Standard_info.dat`



`tweets_distro.dat`
