# Finding the Most Popular Tweet

The most popular tweet is undoubtedly the one that gets retweeted the most. By just looking at the content of the most popular broadcast in a social network, you can get a good idea of what many of the agents in your social network are like. Is there an ideology associated with this popular tweet? A region? Is it a humourous tweet? Did this tweet get retweeted so much partially because the agent who made the tweet was so popular? Perhaps one of that agent's followers was extremely popular, allowing more agents to see that message. It is amazing all the information you can collect from just one simple broadcast. For this tutorial, we are going to run a preconfigured **INFILE.yaml** and find the most popular tweet in the network created. Using this tweet's content as evidence, we are going to draw conclusions about some of the detail of the network, and then analyze the input file and output directory for this simulation to see if we were right.
