#    Whether interactive mode should be triggered by Ctrl+C or ./scripts/stop.sh (triggers SIGUSR1).

# >> tweet_observation: 
#
# An observation probability density function that gives 
# the probability that a tweet is observed at a certain time by an 'ideal observer'. 
# An 'ideal observer' is one which always sees a tweet, eventually.'
# The observation PDF is used for both retweeting and follow-from-tweet.
# We combine this with a relevance factor, r, where 0 <= r <= 1.0, we in turn
# determines the probability that a given agent will act on a given tweet, with enough time.
#
#  density_function:
#    Probability 'density' function to sample logarithmatically.
#    Provided as if a Python function of 'x'. It is integrated using the scipy.integrate module. 
#    Note technically not a true PDF because one does NOT need to have an integral range that sums to 1.0.
#    The function, after integration, _will_ be normalized for you.
#

#    In arbitrary units. The end x-value to integrate to.
#
#  initial_resolution:
#    In arbitrary units. The initial binning resolution. 
#    That is, the x-step with which to begin binning. The binning resolution is decreased from there on.
#  resolution_growth_factor:
#    How quickly the resolution grows from one bin to the next. 
#    Quicker is more efficient, but with less precise rates in later bins.
#  time_span:
#    In minutes. The time over which the function is defined.
#    After this, tweets will 'disappear'.
