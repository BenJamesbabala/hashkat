# Other Methods of Following

In the previous tutorials, we have outlined the various follow models offered by hashkat. When implemented, each one produced a vastly different network, having a huge impact on the connections made by agents. However, when implementing a particular follow model, there are other factors that could be applied to the system to cause agents to follow others outside the framework of that simulation's follow model. These other factors that can be utilized in a network simulation are 'followback' and 'following via retweets'. In this tutorial, we will outline and discuss what these application mean, and compare a network simulation that does not involve these follow methods to a network simulation that does implement them.

All the files that will be used in this simulation can be found for reference in the tutorials directory in hashkat, with the ones used for this tutorial under the titles *tutorial09_without_other_follow* and *tutorial09_with_other_follow* respectively. You can view the input file we will be creating for the network simulation that does not involve the other follow methods [here](), and the network simulation that does involve the other follow methods [here](). This tutorial should take approximately 30 minutes to complete.
