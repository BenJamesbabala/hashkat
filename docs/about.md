At first glance, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) can be viewed as nothing more than an outlet for people to connect with others and speak their mind in 140 characters or less. However, when looking closer, one can find that Twitter truly is an abundant source of information. Through the trending topics people are discussing, and their views on those trends, one can accurately predict which political candidate will win the next election, the potential box office success of a new movie, company sales, etc. With this revelation, one can easily see that social networks contain a lot of valuable, hidden information.

With this project ***#k@***, the Kinetic Analysis of Twitter, we created a program that simulates this social network, striving to find how it evolves and fluctuates over time through implementation of the [Kinetic Monte Carlo Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_Monte_Carlo) and all the functionalities of Twitter, with results that are very close to reproducing the results generated by Twitter.
