--- #KAT ---   Kinetic Analysis of Twitter
===

This is open-source software for generating kinetic complex networks. The events that occur in the simulations are designed to mimic the events that occur in Twitter. These events include following, tweeting, retweeting, unfollowing, and entity creation. An entity in our similations represent users in the online social network of Twitter.
