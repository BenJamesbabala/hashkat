****************** Scale-free Model (method2) ******************

This follow method follows very closely to the preferential attachment
model proposed by Barabasi and Albert. The main difference is that in
this method, the size of the network can be static. The probability
of following an entity is identical to the preferential attachment model.
This method allows entities to follow more than once, and by keeping the
network static, one can expect a certain average out-degree depending on 
the following rates and the maximum amount of time. Currently in the input
file in the current directory ("INFILE.yaml"), the average out-degree for
the entities is 5. This is based on the follow rates having a constant 
rate of 0.005 and the maximum time being 1000 minutes. 

The following in this case is all determined by the thresholds and weights
for the follow ranks.

follow_ranks:
  thresholds: {bin_spacing: linear, min: 0, max: 100000, increment: 1}
  weights:    {bin_spacing: linear, min: 1, max: 100001, increment: 1}
  
The thresholds determine the bin values for holding the entities. For 
example if an entity has 1 follower, that entity will be placed in the 
bin with value = 1. If that same entity obtains another follower, then
the entity will be placed in the bin with value = 2. If this entity is
very popular and exceeds the bin with value 1000001, then this entity
is placed in a bin with a very large value (infinity). The weights
determine the probability of following an entity within a certain bin.
The values for weights are normalized for the thresholds that are holding
entities; this eliminates bins that are holding no entities. The example
above creates the following thresholds and weights:

0,1,2,3,4,5,6,...,1000000
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,...,1000001
