**************** Scale-Free Graph Model ****************

The input file ("INFILE.yaml") placed in this
directory is designed to create a Barabasi-Albert
scale free network with a scaling exponent of 3.
The scaling exponent will not be 3 if the number
of agents in the network is small. Like the 
random graph model, tweeting and retweeting are
turned off for performance.

The first method uses the variable 'use_barabasi'
in the input file. That is 'use_barabasi = true'.
For this method whenever a new agent is added into
the network, they immediately follow another agent
based the degree of the existing agents. For further
information check the documentation regarding follow_method
entitled 'preferential_follow'. The rates
for following should be set to zero, to eliminate any
other follows occurring during the simulation. The 
follow thresholds and weights do not need to be adjusted,
the build in thresholds and weights will take over.

For this simulation you should find that the number of 
follows is approximately equal to the number of users.
