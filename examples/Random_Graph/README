*********** Random Graph Model ***********

The input file ("INFILE.yaml") placed in this
directory is designed to create an Erdos-Renyi 
model as fast as possible. To speed things up 
there is no tweeting and therefore no retweeting
occurring in the network. The degree distributions
should be the exact same as the data files placed
in this directory.

You'll notice that the rate of following is 0.001 
for all of the defined entities. The maximum time
indicated at the top of the input file is 100000. 
Therefore we should expect that the degree 
distributions will have a maximum at 100 (or 200 for
the cumulative degree distribution).

If you do not want to use or do not have gnuplot 
installed on your machine. There is an interactive
ipython notebook titled 'random_graph.ipynb' with a
brief overview of the degree distribution.
