The input file INFILE.yaml will create a graph with the preferential-agent method. This method looks to the probability of following a certain agent type first and then looks to the in-degrees of the agents in a certain agent type. This the preferential attachment mechanism nested inside the follow by agent type mechanism. Tweets and retweets are turned on so agents can follow based on retweet as well.
