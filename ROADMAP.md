#Roadmap

- [ ] 1. Enhance the _interactive_mode_ of `#k@`. 
  * Reference: [INTERACT.lua](https://github.com/hashkat/hashkat/blob/master/INTERACT.lua)
  
- [ ] 2. Develop an API (sort of) for `#k@`
  * This shall be used in the _interactive_mode_
  * Aims to check for the request for after each "n" iterations, query and send back results
  * Planned to be implemened using Python
  
  
- [ ] 3. Create "cool" visualizations for data set generated by the simulations of `#k@`
  * Reference: [chromeexperiments.com/globe](https://www.chromeexperiments.com/globe)
  

- [ ] 4. Work upon the `Test_Suite` of `#k@` and include them in the [Travis CI Automated Build for Hashkat](https://travis-ci.org/hashkat/hashkat)

- [ ] 5. Add new variables to describe an agent's state viz. `susceptibility_to_ideology_change` and `susceptibility_to_music_change` in order to calculate `Rate of persuasion`
